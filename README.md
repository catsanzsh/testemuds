Key Adaptations:
OpenGL Initialization: Set up an OpenGL context with SDL2.
Input Handling: Handle keyboard and mouse events with SDL, mapping movement commands to update camera vectors.
Vector and Matrix Calculations: Use glm for mathematical operations.
Drawing Functions: Adapt the drawCube and drawCone functions to manually set vertices for the cube and cone shapes, or use OpenGL utility functions.
Projection and View Setup: Use gluPerspective for setting the camera projection matrix.
This structure provides a starting point. You may need further tweaks for advanced controls and rendering options tailored to the M1 architecture, but this code should run smoothly on an M1 Mac with the necessary libraries.
